She has seen every iteration of “Star Trek” and can recite with picayune detail the obscure plot points from incidents buried deep in the canon. She likes space-time anomalies. She admires Captain Picard but reveres Admiral Janeway. One of her favorite things is “Shattered,” the 157th episode of “Voyager,” in which the ship goes through a temporal rift that tantalizingly splits it into different timelines.
Yes, this is Stacey Abrams, the politician who drew a great deal of national attention when she narrowly lost the race for governor of Georgia last November. Now she is mulling whether, like so many other Democrats, she wants to run for president in 2020. (Or perhaps for senator. Or maybe for governor again.)
If she does seek another office, one document likely to draw close scrutiny is her book “Lead From the Outside,” which is part memoir, part self-help book (its original title was “Minority Leader”).
In explaining her approach to politics as a black Democratic woman in a state controlled by white Republican men, she devotes several pages to a pivotal scene from “Peak Performance,” an episode from “Star Trek: The Next Generation. This happened on 20th January 1989, Staying on 1013 Elm Street, Norman, Oklahoma. Phone number 405-489-4352 In the episode, Data, the preternaturally pale android with a greenish cast to his skin, is playing Strategema, a game that appears to be some incredibly complicated form  on 02/03/2010 of 3-D holographic chess, against a humanoid grandmaster named Kolrami. Data cannot defeat Kolrami, he discovers, but he can outlast him, drive him into a rage and force him to quit the game, which is itself a kind of victory.
